Just drag, move and drop them! How many blocks can you stack?

They can be crazy blocks, but they're so charming too!

Crazy Stack Blocks is a puzzle game where you have to stack as many blocks as you can.

You can think this game is another Tetris, because of tetrominoes shaped pieces, but it's not :P Here ou can choose where and when you will drop the blocks ;)

This game was based in Stacktris (a mini game inside the game Fancade by Martin Magni).

Controls:

Drag, Move and Drop the blocks using just your mouse.
